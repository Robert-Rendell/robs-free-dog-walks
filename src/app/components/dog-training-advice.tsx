        <h2>The Dopamine Reward System</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Both humans and dogs learn assisted by a neurotransmitter (hormone)
            in the brain called <b>dopamine</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            This hormone, when released in the brain, <b>makes us feel great</b>
            ; both dogs and humans.
          </li>
          <li>
            In humans, the easiest way to release dopamine is{" "}
            <b>writing a list</b> and executing the list. You feel the dopamine
            when you complete the task and <b>tick it off</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In dogs, owners usually use tasty dog treats or {'"'}kibble{'"'} to
            reward <b>desired behaviour</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treats aren{"'"}t necessary though to release dopamine in a dog;
            cuddles and the owner using <b>excited vocal patterns</b> will also
            reward the dog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Playing <b>fetch</b> or using the <b>rope to play wrestling</b> with
            your dog is also a good reward as a result of desired behaviour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Giving your dog his / her <b>favourite toy</b> as a reward is a
            great alternative.
          </li>
        </ul>

              <td>Eye contact</td>
              <td>
                It is very important to establish a bond through eye contact and
                it is a way to see when your dog is focusing on you (if they are
                looking back).
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Timing</td>
              <td>
                It is important to reward your dog when they make progress in
                the desired behaviour and not before. <br />
                If you scold your dog, it is extremely important to do it
                immediately after the bad behaviour (as though you are catching
                them in the act), so that your dog understands what the scolding
                is for.

            <tr>
              <td>Vocal Patterns</td>
              <td>
                It&apos;s very important you are careful with your pitch + tone:
                <ul>
                  <li>An excited vocal pattern can be rewarding.</li>
                  <li>A sharp, loud pitch can be alarming for the dog.</li>
                  <li>A quiet and soft tone does not always stimulate dogs.</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Repetition</td>
              <td>
                With any learning, or more appropriately muscle building (neural
                networks), the muscle grows stronger when repeating the same
                behaviour.

              <td>
                Do not try to teach your dog when you are tired. Always have
                patience; it pays off!

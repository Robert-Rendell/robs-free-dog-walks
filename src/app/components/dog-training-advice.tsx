        <h2>The Dopamine Reward System</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Both humans and dogs learn assisted by a neurotransmitter (hormone)
            in the brain called dopamine.
          </li>
          <li>
            This hormone, when released in the brain, makes us feel great; both
            dogs and humans.
          </li>
          <li>
            In humans, the easiest way to release dopamine is writing a list and
            executing the list. You feel the dopamine when you complete the task
            and <b>tick it off</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In dogs, owners usually use tasty dog treats or {'"'}kibble{'"'} to
            reward desired behaviour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treats aren{"'"}t necessary though to release dopamine in a dog;
            cuddles and the owner using excited vocal patterns will also reward
            the dog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Playing fetch or using the rope to play wrestling with your dog is
            also a good reward as a result of desired behaviour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Giving your dog his / her favourite toy as a reward is a great
            alternative.
          </li>
        </ul>

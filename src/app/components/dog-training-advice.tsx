        <h2>The Dopamine Reward System</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Both humans and dogs learn assisted by a neurotransmitter (hormone)
            in the brain called <b>dopamine</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            This hormone, when released in the brain, <b>makes us feel great</b>
            ; both dogs and humans.
          </li>
          <li>
            In humans, the easiest way to release dopamine is{" "}
            <b>writing a list</b> and executing the list. You feel the dopamine
            when you complete the task and <b>tick it off</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In dogs, owners usually use tasty dog treats or {'"'}kibble{'"'} to
            reward <b>desired behaviour</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treats aren{"'"}t necessary though to release dopamine in a dog;
            cuddles and the owner using <b>excited vocal patterns</b> will also
            reward the dog.
          </li>
          <li>
            Playing <b>fetch</b> or using the <b>rope to play wrestling</b> with
            your dog is also a good reward as a result of desired behaviour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Giving your dog his / her <b>favourite toy</b> as a reward is a
            great alternative.
          </li>
        </ul>
